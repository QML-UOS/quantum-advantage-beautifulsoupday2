In\\\\n [<a href=\"#Wocjan_strings\">59</a>], Janzing and Wocjan showed that a certain string\\\\n rewriting problem is PromiseBQP-complete. Thus quantum computers can solve it in\\\\n polynomial time, but classical computers probably cannot. Given three strings\\\\n <i>s,t,t\\\\\\'</i>, and a set of string rewriting rules satisfying certain promises, the\\\\n problem is to find a certain approximation to the difference between the number of\\\\n ways of obtaining <i>t</i> from <i>s</i> and the number of ways of obtaining <i>t\\\\\\'</i>\\\\n from <i>s</i>. Similarly, certain problems of approximating the difference in number of\\\\n paths between pairs of vertices in a graph, and difference in transition probabilities\\\\n between pairs of states in a random walk are also BQP-complete\\\\n [<a href=\"#Wocjan_walks\">58</a>].\\\\n'},\n",

Suppose we are have\\\\n an \\\\\\\\( N \\\\\\\\times N \\\\\\\\) symmetric matrix <i>A</i> such that there are at most polylog(<i>N</i>)\\\\n nonzero entries in each row, and given a row index, the set of nonzero entries can be\\\\n efficiently computed. The task is, for any 1 &lt; <i>i</i> &lt; <i>N</i>, and any <i>m</i>\\\\n polylogarithmic in <i>N</i>, to approximate \\\\\\\\( (A^m)_{ii} \\\\\\\\) the \\\\\\\\( i^{\\\\\\\\mathrm{th}} \\\\\\\\)\\\\n diagonal matrix element of \\\\\\\\( A^m \\\\\\\\).
